# Starmodder 3

An unofficial Starsector mod database for browsing and searching mods.

## Features

- **Search** - find mods by name, author (with alias support), category, or version. Comma-separated queries and negation (`-term`) are supported.
- **Filter** - narrow results by category or game version.
- **Sort** - by name, date created, or game version.
- **Grid & List views** - toggle between card grid and compact list. Card size is adjustable via a slider.
- **Detail modal** - click any mod to see its full description, image gallery (with drag-to-scroll and lightbox), metadata, and download/forum links.
- **Persistent preferences** - view mode, sort order, and card size are saved to `localStorage`.

## Data Source

Mod data is fetched at runtime from the [StarsectorModRepo](https://github.com/wispborne/StarsectorModRepo) maintained by Wisp.
